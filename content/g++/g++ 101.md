The most basic command is compile a single .cpp file without using any library

```bash
g++ -o output_file source.cpp
```

With specific cpp standard, using `-std=c++11` param


```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o output_file source.cpp
```

To compile & linked with preinstall library (use package manager link brew, apt-get,...), using `-l<your_library_name> param`. Make sure that your library header file & precompiled file are both discoverable

```bash
g++ -o executable source.cpp -lsqlite3
```

If the library is not installed at default location, you can explicit add the include path and library path using `-I` and `-L`.

```bash
g++ -I/opt/sqlite/include ...
g++ -L/opt/sqlite/lib -lsqlite3 ...
```


Define a macro at compile time is pretty simple, just add `-D<YOUR_MACRO_NAME>` or `-D<MACRO_KEY=MACRO_VALUE>`


```bash
g++ -DDEBUG -o executable source.cpp
g++ -DVERSION=5 -o executable source.cpp
```
